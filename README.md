# Short description

 * This app was created mainly for learning and practicing purposes
 * I focused more on the functionality and logic of this web app than on visual aspects like CSS.
 * However, this app is still a work in progress


## Specifications of application:
 
 ***Note:** I worked with some older versions because of compatibility issues.
* NetBeans 13.0 ver.
* JDK 8.0 u331 ver.
* Java EE 7 Web ver.
* Java technologies: Servlet/JSP
* GlassFish server 4.1.1
* Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio v18.11.1 (SSMS) 
* Language: Croatian (for now, but I plan to put the option to switch to ENG)
 

## Instructions

* There is two main difference in functionality: 
  * Administrator functionality (GUI/options)
  * Common user functionality
                                              
* You can test them both if you want
* Admins options are "hard-coded" at least for now because of conveniences
  * **Administrator credentials:**
    * **Username:** Administrator
    * **Password:** admin
    
* For Common User Options, you can just register with a new acc but to make it easier here is one testing acc that is already created and used
  * **Common user acc credentials:**
    * **Username:** pero
    * **Password:** 123
